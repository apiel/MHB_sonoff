v0.1.2 (13 Sep 2015)
	Fixed #14.

v0.1.1 (03 Apr 2015)
	Fixed bug in "abort()".

v0.1.0 (20 Feb 2014)
	Server: Added "host" and "port" public properties.
	Bin: Improved server logging messages.
	Bin: Updated status-bar dependency.

v0.0.18 (18 Feb 2014)
	Client: DNS lookup errors now return a descriptive message.
	Server: The root directory is now validated when "listen()" is called.
	Server: Better error handling in the default "requestListener".
	Server: When a file is being PUTing, another file cannot GET it (ECURPUT), and
		vice versa (ECURGET).
	Bin: The "root" directory of the "--listen" option is now mandatory.
	Bin: Minor bugfixes.

v0.0.17 (08 Feb 2014)
	Now the "abort" event doesn't return any error.
	Client: Removed "highWaterMark" option from all the functions. This option is
		in fact the "blockSize" option. The "highWaterMark" is only applicable in
		the other stream that pushes data to the PutStream, and is not very useful.
	Client: Convert the md5 and sha1 sums to lower case before comparing.
	Client: Renamed "md5sum" and "sha1sum" options to "md5" and "sha1".

v0.0.16 (05 Feb 2014)
	Server: Major internal refactor. The only noticable change in the public API
		is the removal of the "stats" event in favor of a "stats" object attached to
		the "req" parameter. This is a way more simpler to use the API because now
		you have immediate access to the socket (ie. logging purposes).
	Removed the "file" property from the "stats" object.
	The "userExtensions" now defaults to an empty object instead of null.
	Server: Minor bugfixes and improvements.

v0.0.15 (28 Jan 2014)
	Client: Fixed "put()".

v0.0.14 (27 Jan 2014)
	Server: Added minor validations.
	Server: Minor bugfixes.
	Added "close()".

v0.0.13 (26 Jan 2014)
	Server: Deny concurrent PUT requests over the same file.
	Server: The "stats" event is now emitted in a future tick. This allows to
		call the default request listener after the "stats" event and allows to
		create the stream chaining based on the values of the "stats" object.
	Server: Added "setSize()". It must be used with custom request listeners to
		set the size of the response when is a GET request.
	Better maximum size error handling.
	Server: Exposed error codes.
	Server: Now the server doesn't check for initial errors. As soon as a new
		request starts, it creates the streams and emits the "request" event.
	Minor improvements.

v0.0.12 (24 Jan 2014)
	Client: Fixed put stream error handling with empty files.
	Client: Improved maximum size error handling.
	Improved the error checking with DATA and ACK packets.

v0.0.11 (23 Jan 2014)
	Server: Fixed IPv6 socket.

v0.0.10 (22 Jan 2014)
	Allowed error messages with code 0 and no description.

v0.0.9 (21 Jan 2014)
	Client: Added DNS address resolution.
	Added automatic UDP socket type creation (IPv4 or IPv6).
	Renamed "hostname" option to "host".
	Server: When the request is a PUT operation "setUserExtensions()" works
		correctly.

v0.0.8 (21 Jan 2014)
	Server: Allowed aborting a request without calling the default request
		listener.
	Minor internal refactor.

v0.0.7 (20 Jan 2014)
	Bump version.

	Server implemented along with a major refactor of the client.
	Fixed the reception of user extensions sent by the server.
	Added the server setup in the cli script.
	Changed the sockets of the stats object.
	Minor tweaks, checks and bugfixes.

v0.0.5 (16 Jan 2014)
	An error message can be passed to "abort()". This is an informative message
		that is sent to the server.
	Minor bugfixes.

v0.0.4 (13 Jan 2014)
	Added "highWaterMark" option to "get()", "put()", "createGetStream()" and
		"createPutStream()".

v0.0.3 (11 Jan 2014)
	If the server sends unknown extensions now the client fails correctly.
	The "userExtensions" property has been moved from "createClient()" to "get()",
		"put()", "createGetStream()" and "createPutStream()".
	Fixed error while retransmitting a bad request.
	Properly check if the file is too big to be sent.
	Minor improvements.

v0.0.2 (06 Jan 2014)
	Fixed error with the sums.
	Don't wait to the callback after sending a packet.
