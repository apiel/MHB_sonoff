/*
This example demonstrates how to close the server and all the current
connections gracefully.

This is slightly different from the http server where the "connection" event
returns the socket and you must call to socket.destroy() to close it. On the
other hand, this tftp server doesn't have a "connection" event because the
internal socket is not exposed to the public, it just has a "request" event
which is fired each time the server receives a new request. The "req" argument
acts like a "connection" object. When req.abort() is called it sends an error
message to the client and then the socket closes, that is, it's a real graceful
shutdown. Instead of killing the socket by brute force, the server informs the
client that the transfer has been aborted, so the client is able to abort the
transfer immediately instead of begin a timeout and then abort.

		//Error from the request
		console.error (error);

	//Save the connection
	connections.push (req);
	
	//The "close" event is fired when the internal socket closes, regardless
	//whether it is produced by an error, the socket closes naturally due to the
	//end of the transfer or the transfer has been aborted
	req.on ("close", function (){
		//Remove the connection
		connections.splice (connections.indexOf (this), 1);
